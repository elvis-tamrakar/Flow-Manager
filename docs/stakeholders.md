Managers : Managers are responsible for reviewing and approving requests, assigning work, and monitoring progress. They require clear visibility into task status, priorities, and potential bottlenecks to ensure expectations are met and deadlines are realistic. Managers are primary decision-makers within the system.

Employees (Requesters) : Employees submit requests and depend on timely feedback, clear ownership, and transparent status updates. The system enables them to focus on execution without uncertainty around approvals, priorities, or unrealistic timelines.

Analysts / Executors : Analysts are responsible for carrying out approved tasks. They rely on well-defined requirements, prioritization, and communication channels to efficiently deliver outcomes and flag dependencies or blockers.

IT / System Administrators : The IT department is responsible for maintaining the system, managing user access, applying patches, handling upgrades, and ensuring system reliability, security, and version control.
