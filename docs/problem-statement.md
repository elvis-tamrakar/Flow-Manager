- Modern teams often rely on fragmented communication channels such as emails, chat messages, and informal verbal requests to manage internal work. As a result, deadlines are missed, expectations between employees and managers become unclear, and progress is not tracked consistently.

- These issues may go unnoticed during early stages of a project or development lifecycle, but they tend to compound over time. When they surface during critical phases, they can introduce delays, misalignment, rework, and increased risk to product delivery and operational stability.

- There is a clear need for a centralized system that enables teams to submit, review, approve, execute, and track internal requests in a structured and transparent manner.
